It&rsquo;s a typical setup: They have 30/50 amp service in full hookups and the owners are always willing to help you out. They also have a washer and dryer on site.&rdquo;

				&ldquo;Very well run, clean, and quiet. They unquestionably have the best wifi we&rsquo;ve ever experienced in an RV Park. Even during peak use periods you could easily access URLs. The only issue is that bathroom and shower facilities are inadequate &mdash; one unisex facility for the park. None-the-less we would return.&rdquo;

				&ldquo;I&rsquo;ve driven past Tucumcari several times but had not been &ldquo;in the right place at the right time&rdquo; for an overnight stop &hellip; I was very pleased that the manager (Mike? Cell ph connection wasn&rsquo;t the best do not certain of his name) came out to meet me even though I pulled in after office hours (close to 9 p.m.) &amp; then drove over to give me my change even when I assured him that wasn&rsquo;t necessary ($23 is a great bargain for a horse motel w/nice safe pens &amp; running water right in front!) My mare also enjoyed the green grass which she hadn&rsquo;t seen much of during our previous week of travel &hellip; Blaze In Saddle will definitely be on our &ldquo;safe &amp; solid place to stop&rdquo; list!&rdquo;

				&ldquo;Extremely accommodating, courteous, and offers great daily rate. Accepted our last minute reservation for a 1 night stay while moving from California to Connecticut. Had a level pad with reliable electric, water, and sewage. You can tell this owner cares a lot about keeping his property looking and working great and about the comfort of his tenants. The bathroom and shower worked perfectly for us, as we had a 2-month-old in need of a bath. The large shower stall helped out greatly with that. I hope we&rsquo;ll have a chance to stay here again someday. The view of the mountain was a wonderful way to end an otherwise stressful driving day across New Mexico.&rdquo;

				&ldquo;We enjoyed our one-night stay at this park. I&rsquo;m glad we passed the park right off 40 and drove another mile to Blaze In Saddle RV Park. The new owners are very nice and are doing wonderful things here. No pool but they&rsquo;re planning on one in the future. Washer and dryer was xlg capacity brand new machines. We did not use bathhouse (not positive there is one since we never need). Nice dog run. Driveway was a bit steep especially if towing. The owners are incredibly nice and I wish them all the best of luck with their new park. I think they have a gem.&rdquo;

				&ldquo;No pool but full 50a hookups for $20. Clean and friendly with level sites make for a perfect overnighter. New owners are in the middle of construction reworking the place. I&rsquo;ll be back whenever I come to the area.&rdquo;
