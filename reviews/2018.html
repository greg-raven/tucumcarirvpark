					&ldquo;This place is perfect for anyone with an RV traveling across I-40, and if you have horses or pets, even better. The owners greeted us upon arrival and helped us get our outdoor pens situated for our horse. Hers had a covered lean to, which was perfect for our needs. He then guided us into our space. They have everything you need to hook up. This place is convenient and easy highway access. Very clean and close to restaurants, and more. We really appreciated the hospitalities received from John, Mike, and Ron, and will definitely stay there again when traveling through.&rdquo;

					&ldquo;We stumbled onto this Horse Motel and what a gem. The owner Silvo was amazing. He was courteous and answered all of our questions and then some. A great sense of humor, too. The RV Park is very clean and well lit up at night. The shower room and laundry room are very clean and refreshing after long days on the road. Silvo even walked us out to the horse site and made sure everything was to our standards. He even gave us recommendations for a great restaurant! We will definitely stop again when we travel to AZ! Thank you!&rdquo;

					&ldquo;Unless you&rsquo;re looking for a pool or other amenities, this is a great park. Traveling in our 43-foot motorhome, this is the kind of park we look for. Friendly owners, long flat pull-through, quiet, good utilities, and a reasonable price. It provides easy access to town, a nice view of Mt. Tucumcari, and is far enough away from the noise of I-40. Easy in and out. We stayed two days, and will stop again if coming through. BTW, the owner advised the city water pressure is 100 psi, so best to have a pressure regulator.&rdquo;

					<strong>Convenient location with clean and level sites</strong>
				</p>
				<p>
					We had a great experience here! The sites are extremely clean and level. The wifi was very strong without using any sort of booster (strong enough to stream channels on our Roku TV and Skype). Full bars for both Sprint and Verizon cell service. The owners are very helpful and friendly. Finally, the laundry room is awesome! Big new residential style machines; no quarters needed; its $3 per load at the front desk to wash and dry. All in all we give this place 5 thumbs up and we will definitely stay here again if we&rsquo;re in the area.

					<strong>Exceptional Experience</strong>
				</p>
				<p>
					This small park is recently under new ownership with rebranding under this new name. The new owners have this park, neat, clean, and are very hospitable. They even take you to your site and make sure all is well. Level, gravel lots, great hook-ups. They have a clean, neat laundry area. One bathroom and shower area, just like home (so there might be a slight delay if they were super busy), but I doubt you will find a cleaner one. Trash receptacles conveniently located. Dog run and even places for horses. Not too close to the road so noise didn&rsquo;t seem to be a problem. An exceptional value in our opinion.

					<strong>We got our kicks on Route 66!</strong>
				</p>
				<p>
					What a great RVing experience! We were headed from Albuquerque to Wellington, TX, for Nomad Fest and wanted to have a little stopover in Tucumcari to check out some of the Route 66 nostalgia. We got on Campendium and looked for RV parks and this one came up. We then googled it and read the reviews. People were raving about the new ownership and all of the positive updating and upgrades being done to the park.
				</p>
				<p>
					I called from the road and they were almost full but had a space for us. We were not going to be arriving until about 8 p.m. and they said they would be there for us. We showed up and were greeted by a very friendly host (one of the owners) who checked us in and lead us to our spot, in the dark with the wind blowing and the temp about 40 degrees. We set up our rig and settled in.
				</p>
				<p>
					The next morning we discovered the dog park which our crew loved and visited the office to join Passport America and pay for the next two nights. This place is neat! It is right on Historic Route 66, close to town, clean, well kept, has shower and laundry facilities, nice level and large spaces, and even horse pens if you are horse people. It is a quiet park with full hookups and reasonable rates.
				</p>
				<p>
					We will definitely be coming back to stay here again!

Cell ph connection wasn&rsquo;t the best do not certain of his name) came out to meet me even though I pulled in after office hours (close to 9 p.m.) &amp; then drove over to give me my change even when I assured him that wasn&rsquo;t necessary ($23 is a great bargain for a horse motel w/nice safe pens &amp; running water right in front!)

					&ldquo;Extremely accommodating, courteous, and offers great daily rate. Accepted our last minute reservation for a 1 night stay while moving from California to Connecticut. Had a level pad with reliable electric, water, and sewage. You can tell this owner cares a lot about keeping his property looking and working great and about the comfort of his tenants. The bathroom and shower worked perfectly for us, as we had a 2-month-old in need of a bath. The large shower stall helped out greatly with that. I hope we&rsquo;ll have a chance to stay here again someday. The view of the mountain was a wonderful way to end an otherwise stressful driving day across New Mexico.&rdquo;

The new owners are very nice and are doing wonderful things here. No pool but they&rsquo;re planning on one in the future. Washer and dryer was xlg capacity brand new machines. We did not use bathhouse (not positive there is one since we never need). Nice dog run. Driveway was a bit steep especially if towing. The owners are incredibly nice and I wish them all the best of luck with their new park. I think they have a gem.&rdquo;

					&ldquo;Our first impression was that this looked like a hobby park, something a fraternal organization or gun club might maintain for its members &mdash; just a lot in back of a building, deceptively small, yet with 35 slots on site, all flat level, with some grass. The park was nearly empty. Upon entering, I was immediately served by two extremely helpful gentlemen. Their website offers a &lsquo;Special Grand Opening/Construction phase nightly rate,&rsquo; which they charged me without my having to request it. (Later, I found out that the &lsquo;Construction&rsquo; part was that there was no working bath/restroom, a bit of a surprise, but we rolled with it.) We had the freedom to select our own site, and so picked one where the hookups were located conveniently for us. They were all in good repair and worked fine. There are a few mature shade trees, but not many; some young trees have been planted to fill in. I uprated the park because I felt the $20 rate was a fair trade for the missing bathhouse (I just wish it had been clearly stated up front so I wouldn&rsquo;t have trekked out to the locked-up room in my shower togs.)&rdquo;
