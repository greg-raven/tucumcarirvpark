							Because of a breakdown our 2-night stay turned into a 2-night + 3 more nights. The owners were quite nice about it and found a spot for us for the additional nights and even moved us to our favorite site here (#35) with privacy and a nice view.
						</p>
						<p>
							The campground is mostly an overnight stop so we got to see lots of folks coming and going. The spaces are large with a good amount of room between sites. The grounds are very nicely maintained and all looked fresh and new. All services worked well and each had a picnic table if you wanted one.
						</p>
						<p>
							We definitely would stay here again &hellip; good job!

							I&rsquo;m new to RV camping and this is the fifth RV park I stayed at on a month-long road trip from Miami. Amazing place. The owners are very kind and the place is extremely well kept. The bathroom is so clean and comfortable (there are separate stalls with toilets and showers). All of this on top of being on one of the coolest parts of the old Route 66 strip. Highly recommended. I would definitely stay here again.

Everyone there was friendly and courteous to their neighbors. The owners were very nice, and even helped us out when our truck had problems as we were leaving the lot. Can&rsquo;t thank them enough!&rdquo;

They even have horse corrals for those folks who stop with their livestock. We&rsquo;ve never seen that before ever in our travels. You would go a long way before you&rsquo;d find a nicer park with nicer folks. We will visit them again on our way back to Utah. Thank you Don and Silvio.&rdquo;

							&ldquo;My husband and I stayed at this wonderful RV park. From the time we arrived we felt comfortable and safe. Anything we needed help with they were right there and would go above and beyond. From all 3 brothers and Ron. We stayed at the park for 2 months. This park is clean and very well maintained. I just want to say thank you to John, Mike, Sylvio, and Ron, I would also like to add God bless and thank you for your service to our country to all 4 of you. We hope to be passing through again and will definitely stay at Blaze-In-Saddle RV Park.&rdquo;

							&ldquo;This is a small RV park just outside the small town of Tucumcari, New Mexico. It&rsquo;s owned and ran by 2 brothers who were both very gracious and helpful. Can&rsquo;t rate facilities as they were closed due to COVID-19, but the park was quiet and easy to maneuver around. Spaces were well spaced and staggered so all hook ups for neighboring sites were on one side. I would stay here again if ever passing through. Decent view of Mt. Tucumcari.&rdquo;

Owner/manager Mike is very virus-aware and kept us in the coach at check-in, coming out to our window with a quick and efficient system. Local restaurant, Cornerstone, delivered a nice reasonably-priced dinner to our site! Will definitely be back!&rdquo;

(You never know who you&rsquo;ll meet anywhere.) Had a nice chat about music. Nice spot in a nice, clean, quiet park for the night. Level pads. Used the shower and must say, it was like being home. Nice new three separate house-type bathrooms. Laundry too. Would have stayed another day or two if we needed.&rdquo;

							&ldquo;Very welcoming campground. I wish I had a horse with me because it would have been well accommodated in their available stalls. Washrooms are of a residential style, with toilet, sink, and shower all in one room (great for families with children), unlike most campgrounds I have visited. Only spent one night while passing through, but would return for a longer stay in the future.&rdquo;

The card has no mention of Good Sam discount even though flag is flying and it&rsquo;s in our Good Sam book. Good rate of $27. The owner came round and requested a fee for the third person even though I mentioned the Good Sam discount which means I already over paid.

							&ldquo;Stayed twice for several nights each time during the summer. The three brothers who own the park are awesome; they even escort you to your site to make sure it&rsquo;s okay. Liked the views, and the division between some of the sites, clearly marking boundaries (and helping prevent walk throughs). Had a great site overlooking Tucumcari Mountain. Locals told us that they had bought a very rundown park and it was obvious that they have worked hard to change that, and they continue to make improvements. We even saw positive changes between our two stops (a few weeks apart). Loved their location right on Route 66, and in/near Tucumcari, but still convenient from the Interstate Highway. We did not use any facilities except at our site, but noticed that they take horses, and have a place for vehicle/RV washes. We wish them great luck with their park!! They deserve it. We traveled in a large 5th wheel. The sites are gravel, and have fire pits and picnic tables/benches. All the hookups were new, and were great.&rdquo;

							&ldquo;My husband and I are traveling through the U.S. and we stopped in this campground for the night. All I can say is it is a very nice campground, very nicely organized and clean. A place that you must check out! They even have a place for horses! Also you must check out Route 66 in town. We like that it&rsquo;s not far from Interstate 40.

							&ldquo;You can tell the owners take a lot of pride in this park. We would like to thank them for all of their hard work keep up the good work!&rdquo;

							&ldquo;Nice surprise. Well run and someone is actually maintaining the place. Friendly staff and clean (very clean) shower and restroom. Nice setup, as there were three shower rooms and large step-in showers and toilet and vanity. This setup is preferred as my wife and I can shower together to save time, save water (yes we were married in the 60s), and avoid the shampoo sharing dance. The local pizza place delivered right to our spot. Good overnight stop.&rdquo;

							&ldquo;We were going to stop at Mountain Road RV Park, but when we pulled in, no one was there and it looked pretty bad. We found this park about a mile away, and although they are both gravel parks, this one definitely looks more inviting. Three brothers own the park, and two of them helped me find a site that was perfect for us. It is somewhat lit at night, and it is gravel. Electricity was 118 V, the bathrooms were clean and nice with showers. This is great for an overnight pull-through.&rdquo;

							&ldquo;Very nice no frills RV park. Owners very friendly and give discount to vets and first responders. No shade but I think that just goes with the area. I would definitely stay again. One night stays very reasonably priced.&rdquo;

							&ldquo;Can&rsquo;t say enough about the staff and their help, as well as letting us get pulled in by a wrecker after the RV blew the right front tire on the hwy. They have full hook ups, but informed us of their extremely high water pressure, which is easily fixed with a pressure reducer, which we did not have, so the warning was nice. Hopeful the next visit will be minus the tire blow out. Thanks for the great stay!&rdquo;

							&ldquo;Stopped to and from Phoenix from AR. The brothers are friendly and run a nice park that is being steadily improved. There was only one shower/restroom on the way out. They were finishing up a second on the way back and had started on a third. Wife hopes they make one for women only. Nothing fancy but neat and well kept with reasonable rates.&rdquo;

The park is very well taken care of by the new owners. They are really doing an incredible job. WAY BETTER THEN THE KOA OR ANY OTHER PARK IN THE AREA BY FAR!!! I plan on stopping to stay here every time I&rsquo;m heading down I-40. If you decide to stay here check out the Local BBQ down in town called Watsons.

							&ldquo;We love Blaze In Saddle RV Park! We have stayed there twice and will be back again in the spring. We were driving from Albuquerque to Texas for a RV Festival last fall and decided to push through and get to Tucumcari. We found Blaze In Saddle online and gave them a call. We told them it would likely be late when we got in and they kindly said &lsquo;we will be waiting for you!&rsquo; True to their word, we rolled in about 8 p.m. in the cold and dark, we were greeted by the kind, friendly owners and checked in. They guided us to our spot with our 44-foot toy hauler in tow in the dark. The sites were plenty large enough for our rig and we loved the motion-activated lights on the posts along the way &hellip; we even bought one to stick to the side of our trailer above the door. :) They asked if we needed any assistance setting up and wished us good night. The next day we decided to stay another night and we ended up buying our Passport America membership from them and it has paid for itself over and over again, including applying to our stay that night! They have a dog park which our three dogs loved, and how cool is it to be able to stay on Historic Route 66? Fast forward to February of this year and we were again headed back toward Texas and decided to hammer down and make Tucumcari! We called Blaze In Saddle and they remembered us! I said, &lsquo;We are doing it again, coming in late!&rsquo; They said, &lsquo;No worries, we will be here waiting!&rsquo; We again had another three days here and enjoyed ourselves. There were also many new improvements to the park with more to come. This park is clean, well kept, friendly, safe, and you just can&rsquo;t beat the location. We highly recommend staying at Blaze In Saddle and will be back again soon!&rdquo;

The owners greeted us upon arrival and helped us get our outdoor pens situated for our horse. Hers had a covered lean to, which was perfect for our needs. He then guided us into our space. They have everything you need to hook up. This place is convenient and easy highway access. Very clean and close to restaurants, and more. We really appreciated the hospitalities received from John, Mike, and Ron, and will definitely stay there again when traveling through.&rdquo;

The RV Park is very clean and well lit up at night. The shower room and laundry room are very clean and refreshing after long days on the road. Silvo even walked us out to the horse site and made sure everything was to our standards. He even gave us recommendations for a great restaurant! We will definitely stop again when we travel to AZ!

							&ldquo;Unless you&rsquo;re looking for a pool or other amenities, this is a great park. Traveling in our 43-foot motorhome, this is the kind of park we look for. Friendly owners, long flat pull-through, quiet, good utilities, and a reasonable price. It provides easy access to town, a nice view of Mt. Tucumcari, and is far enough away from the noise of I-40. Easy in and out. We stayed two days, and will stop again if coming through. BTW, the owner advised the city water pressure is 100 psi, so best to have a pressure regulator.&rdquo;

Had a level pad with reliable electric, water, and sewage. You can tell this owner cares a lot about keeping his property looking and working great and about the comfort of his tenants. The bathroom and shower worked perfectly for us, as we had a 2-month-old in need of a bath. The large shower stall helped out greatly with that. I hope we&rsquo;ll have a chance to stay here again someday. The view of the mountain was a wonderful way to end an otherwise stressful driving day across New Mexico.&rdquo;

We did not use bathhouse (not positive there is one since we never need). Nice dog run. Driveway was a bit steep especially if towing. The owners are incredibly nice and I wish them all the best of luck with their new park. I think they have a gem.&rdquo;

							&ldquo;No pool but full 50a hookups for $20. Clean and friendly with level sites make for a perfect overnighter. New owners are in the middle of construction reworking the place. I&rsquo;ll be back whenever I come to the area.&rdquo;

							&ldquo;Our first impression was that this looked like a hobby park, something a fraternal organization or gun club might maintain for its members &mdash; just a lot in back of a building, deceptively small, yet with 35 slots on site, all flat level, with some grass. The park was nearly empty. Upon entering, I was immediately served by two extremely helpful gentlemen. Their website offers a &lsquo;Special Grand Opening/Construction phase nightly rate,&rsquo; which they charged me without my having to request it. (Later, I found out that the &lsquo;Construction&rsquo; part was that there was no working bath/restroom, a bit of a surprise, but we rolled with it.) We had the freedom to select our own site, and so picked one where the hookups were located conveniently for us. They were all in good repair and worked fine. There are a few mature shade trees, but not many; some young trees have been planted to fill in. I uprated the park because I felt the $20 rate was a fair trade for the missing bathhouse (I just wish it had been clearly stated up front so I wouldn&rsquo;t have trekked out to the locked-up room in my shower togs.)&rdquo;

							&ldquo;I think it&rsquo;s definitely worth the $20.00 to get away from the reefers, and get all the hookups. Staff is friendly. They also have some corrals in the back if you&rsquo;re hauling horses.&rdquo;
